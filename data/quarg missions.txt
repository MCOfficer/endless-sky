They live at peace with most sentient species and claim to be in communication with an even older species named the Drak.`

And they hold the secret of travel beyond those pathways, and give the secret only to a worthy few, so that peace may prevail."

			`	"We the Quarg are unique of all the species in the galaxy. Our species began on the moon of a great gas giant, on a planet most small, that gathered about itself very little air. We cannot step many steps on the worlds that the Hai, the Korath, the other species desire. And the worlds like our home, you could not breathe their so thin air, for our lungs are very subtle. And we are an old race, and do not kill for sport or whimsy, so the Drak gave us the gift, that we may go among the other races and settle where we please, and make friends of all, because none dare be our enemy."`

			`	Most of the Quarg you see are dressed entirely in shades of grey, or only slight hints of color. Quarg fashion seems to revolve not around color, but texture: coarse and fine woven fabrics, patterns like lizard scales or cobblestones, and occasional decorative fringes of sponge-like material. Their skin is deep grey, sometimes with a hint of green or blue or brown beneath it, with a fine scale pattern like a reptile. But what makes their eyes startling is that they look very human, except that some of them have gold or violet irises instead of green or blue or brown. They have no hair, but many are wearing small cloth caps or hoods.`
