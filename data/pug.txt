			`	You land your ship. Your sensors say the air is safe to breathe, but you wear a respirator just in case as you step off your ship and explore the depot. The spider robots pay no attention to you. From the fact that some of the tanks are covered in frost and others are not, you would guess that each one contains a different fuel, and each tank has dozens of different connectors branching off from it. With surprise, you discover that one of those connectors is the style used in human space, and you are able to use it to refuel your ship.`

If you stand to block their path, they step around you, and you determine by intentionally bumping into one of them that they are real and not just a holographic projection. From the brief eye contact that a few of them make before looking away from you, you get the feeling that they are intentionally ignoring you.`
