	description "A former owner of this ship apparently didn't like the lithe Raven, and has added so much more to it - more weapons, more shields, and more outfit capacity - that the central hull can only be recognized because of the wings. Besides adding a turret, this ship has enormous gun ports, making you wonder how much more deadly you could possibly make a warship this small."

This aftermarket model also features a turret mount, perhaps in an answer to Lionheart's Headhunter. The shop that built this ship is sure to see more customers."

	description `After the Syndicate released their Vanguard Heavy Warship, the Manta fell somewhat out of favor due to its lack of ability to mount any anti-missile turrets. The owner of this Manta rectified that, added some extra armor plating and shield emitters, and rearranged some of the internals to yield a little more outfit space. Dry tonnage alone keeps it from being classified as a heavy warship.`

	description "Whoever modified this Raven has given more heft to an agile and elegant vessel. They've added a turret and some apparently-flimsy bulkheads over extra shield emitters and outfit space. If it weren't for the wings, the central hull would barely be recognizeable as Lionheart's original under the patchwork that you expect has made an already deadly warship even more so."

Style was not lost on that captain, and a forked tail yielded a little more space for shield projectors in an area that would have been destabilized by engine exhaust. If its dry tonnage were any higher, it would be classified as a heavy warship.`
