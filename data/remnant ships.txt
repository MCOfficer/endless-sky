	description "Centuries ago, the Remnant built these ships in order to explore the upper atmosphere of nearby gas giants. The Archons took issue with the Remnant's research methods, and the studies were unable to be completed. The remaining gascraft have been gathering dust in storage for centuries while the Remnant wait to see if the anger of the Archons will subside."
	description "The Petrel is a multi-role mining/wing leader fightercraft designed to provide support for flights of lighter Terns in high-risk environments. The ship's design originated as an urban mobile gun platform that flitted around structures and natural terrain, but proved easy to adapt into a spacecraft."

	description "The Pelican is closely based on the original semi-organic materials the Remnant found in the Ember Waste. While they are not technically alive, their internal mechanisms and method of construction bear such a close resemblance to living organisms that they are often considered as such. One key feature of this living resemblence is the innate sensory capabilities they posses, akin to sensor suites less advanced ships require for detailed scanning. These ships serve as the backbone of Remnant bulk salvage efforts, as well as their fast-logistics distribution network."
