Thanks to my exceptional grades in university, I was offered a government job even before graduation. I've been working directly for the Deep for the past 35 years and counting, and I've loved every minute of it! My younger sister though... well, let's just say she wasn't so focused on being successful in school and ended up on the wrong side of the law.`
