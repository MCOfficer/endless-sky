	description `Travelers were originally designed as science vessels, thousands of years ago before the Saryds had catalogued all the life forms and physical phenomena of every world in Coalition space. Today, many Saryd communities still choose to live in a Traveler and journey together from system to system rather than putting down roots on a planet.`

	description `When the first wars were fought against the Quarg, the Saryds had been spacefaring for more than ten thousand Earth years, and their starship technology was considerably more advanced than the Kimek or the Arachi. At that time, ships similar to the modern Sojourner were the most powerful capital ships in the Coalition fleet.`
	description `The Kimek love traveling so much that some of them will happily spend months at a time in a transport this size, and the passengers often grow into a tight-knit community by the end of their journeys together.`

	description `The Arach Transport is the oldest of their ship designs, dating back to the time when they first joined the Coalition in overthrowing the Quarg and capturing their ringworlds. Back then, Transports were occasionally used as warships, but now, thousands of years later, they are considered outdated compared to the latest Heliarch military ships.`
	description `Arach cargo ship hulls are legendary for their durability. It is not uncommon for a large Arach family to convert a freighter that is no longer space-worthy into a planet-side dwelling, and even in the harshest of conditions these converted houses can last for hundreds of years with little or no exterior maintenance.`
