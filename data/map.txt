The people who came to New Greenland were looking for a world so marginal and undesirable that they could live here in peace without being caught in the crossfire. The locals here grow food in greenhouses and specialize in making warm winter clothing, which is this planet's only export.`

The textile mills are hot and poorly ventilated, but they offer higher and more reliable income than farming.`

As improbable as it may seem, the void sprites must have somehow evolved the capability to manipulate gravity fields, because every once in a while one of them will rise up from the surface powered by an antigravity field similar to the landing repulsors used by human ships. When they do so, the decrease in atmospheric pressure causes them to nearly double in size.`

Because Polaris is on the very fringe of human space, and because of the wealth of its economy, piracy is a constant threat. Although recently the Syndicate has provided good protection, in past centuries it was not unheard of for raiding parties of starships to attack major port cities here, carrying off valuable cargo and sometimes also human slaves.`

A long enclosed terminal building extends out from the smelter, with docking tubes and landing pads every few hundred meters for connecting to visiting ships. Small robotic trolleys carry cargo crates back and forth; only a handful of people are walking around here, and most of them are probably off-worlders.`

It is well-known that the planet sponsors pirate fleets which bring it cheap materials to bolster its economy, but the planet is so far from the center of Republic space that fighting a war here would be prohibitively expensive, and so they remain unopposed.`

Most of the hotels and restaurants are in a central tower, slightly higher than the others. There is no central marketplace; instead, you can just buy or sell cargo from a computer terminal and a robotic forklift will arrive at your docking bay to carry it.`

However, aside from a few stunted plants and lichen, there is almost no native life here. Given how skilled the Hai appear to be at terraforming other worlds, it is strange that this one has been left barren.`

The planet was mainly used for fishing, leading to a lack of infrastructural development. The few buildings that had been built on the coast lines were swiftly destroyed by the Ka'het and have since been washed away by the ocean waves. The ruins that remain are of a small city, well inside the mainland, far from where the oceans could erase it.`

Another, equally large species of spider is able to leap four or five meters into the air in order to snatch a bird out of a passing flock. The rainforest trees grow so thick that except for occasional clearings, very little light actually filters through the leaves and reaches the ground, and during the rainy season the dirt is transformed into pools of stagnant mud.`

Some of the solar farms are so large that from orbit, the light reflecting off them could almost be mistaken for lakes and small oceans. However, there is almost no water on the planet's surface except near the poles.`

The ships are designed to incubate algae and other microorganisms that once provided the Korath both with food and with a source of mixed hydrocarbons similar to petroleum. With the Korath gone and the food no longer needed, many of the ships have fallen into disrepair, or have drifted into the polar regions and been crushed against icebergs.`

Fourteen thousand years later, their culture is still haunted by fear of not having enough food, and in response they have developed enough farms in their region of space to feed a population three times their size. Much of the food that they produce each year is either put into storage or simply recycled back into fertilizer for next year's crop.`

The shipyards claim that this vacation time is partly responsible for the high reliability of the ships built here, because a well-rested and relaxed worker is less likely to make the sort of mistakes that can quickly become disastrous in outer space.`

It is here that they built their capital, in a deep valley that is almost always shrouded in clouds. In meadows farther up the mountain slopes, a few particularly hardy food crops are grown, but for the most part the Remnant relies on artificial greenhouses or cultured yeast for protein supplements. Remnant cuisine is unlikely to ever become a draw for tourists, even if their isolation here is broken.`

	description `Smuggler's Den was formerly known as Grendel Station, back when it was an operating refinery. But, it has since been taken over by pirates, who turned it into a haven for all manner of smugglers and privateers. As a hub of pirate activity, Smuggler's Den has access to fenced goods from beyond the region, resulting in repair shops that can make a variety of legal and illegal modifications to your ship. This confluence also provides the opportunity to buy refurbished starships... if it does not trouble your conscience to think about the likely fates of their previous owners. Rumor has it that pilots with the right connections may be able to purchase heavily modified ships here.`

From them hang hull fragments, engines, and even a few small ships, each being swung from one location within the shipyard to another. Meanwhile, forklifts and flatbed trucks are weaving between the buildings in every direction.`

The farms, too, are almost indistinguishable from natural land, due to a permaculture system where many varieties of plants are growing side by side.`

For centuries the locals have been trying to find a deposit of diamonds, which would sell for much higher prices than sapphires, and local folklore revolves around the prosperity that would come to this world if diamonds were ever discovered.`

Most of the Hai settlements here are in the valleys closer to sea level, where the air is dense enough for them to breathe comfortably. The tectonic activity has left many ancient sea-beds exposed, providing access to bountiful supplies of oil. To the Hai, oil is too precious a resource to be used for fuel; instead they process it into plastic and use the byproducts in other chemical processes.`
	spaceport `The spaceport is rudimentary, and the main pressurized dome of the facility is probably at least half a millennium old. So many metal foil patches have been cemented to its outer wall to stop slow air leaks that in places they entirely cover the surface. Everything is so ancient and ramshackle that it feels almost like you have stepped back in time to the early days of human space flight. Perhaps that's what the tourists come here to experience.`

Like most Quarg worlds, the gravity is much too low here for it to be a feasible human colony, and although there is an atmosphere, it is too thin for a human being to breathe. Supposedly the Quarg have lungs designed for a continuous one way airflow, like a bird's lungs, rather than the ordinary in and out flow of human lungs; this is what enables them to survive on low-gravity, low-atmosphere worlds.`

The few settlers who live here mostly farm the deep canyons; the mesas above are dry and almost lifeless.`

Most of the inhabitants live deep underground to avoid the hot sunlight and frequent sandstorms. It is a dangerous life; cave-ins are common in the mines, and the sand on the surface can shift so suddenly that it is not uncommon for one of the underground villages to find its surface entrance buried, and to need to call for help from another village. But the mines operate with a joint ownership model where all the workers profit equally, so working here pays well. Many of the miners stay here only for five or ten years, while sending money back to their families off-world.`
