	description "This engine draws enough power that a ship with anything short of a full-fledged nuclear reactor is unlikely to be able to use it, but the thrust it generates is impressive."
	description `When designing the Barb, the Syndicate took the opportunity to integrate their smallest thruster models to create a more compact steering and thrusting engine. The result is not very useful on anything but a fighter, and is only "adequate" in that role. Still, if engine space is at a premium, this is the smallest set of engines that will still get you there (eventually).`
	description "Impala class thrusters produce a significant amount of force, and are suitable for smaller capital ships. But, your ship may need extra cooling systems in order to handle them."

	description "For pilots who want to be able to pull fancy tricks that most ships are not capable of emulating, a reverse thruster allows a ship to accelerate backwards, without needing to turn around. Because a reverse thruster must be facing forwards, it must be installed in the weapon section of your ship instead of the engine section."
