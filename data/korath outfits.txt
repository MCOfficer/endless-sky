	description "In response to occasional raids by the robotic war machines left behind after their recent conflict, the Kor Efret have developed this minimal, spartan command center that can be installed in a captured robotic ship to allow a pilot to override the AI and interface with the ship's controls. The command center only provides a single bunk for the captain, so more may be necessary if the ship has turrets or other systems that require crew."

Their ships would often end up stranded after they had run out of fuel and were unable to escape from the Hai military fleets, prompting the creation of this hybrid fuel storage and ramscoop device. These outfits are now the main source of fuel for the remaining Korath in the galaxy."
