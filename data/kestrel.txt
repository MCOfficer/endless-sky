			`	"Well," he says, "here's the story. Seven years ago, in a time of deep personal crisis, I left my job at Tarazed to wander the galaxy with nothing in my backpack but a change of clothes, a canteen of water, and a few boxes of emergency rations. An anarchist commune on one of the fringe worlds took me in. After I had been there for a month, the village elder, sensing my inner turmoil, invited me to a vision quest in their sweat lodge. I fell into a trance and my consciousness journeyed through many universes, where I saw strange things. I saw a sword made of light. I saw a blue sun. I saw..." He pauses for a moment. "...a Welsh Corgi hacking into a computer? Some of it was hard to understand."`
