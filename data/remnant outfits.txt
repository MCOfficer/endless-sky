Without a supply of new tentacles to use, the Remnant have been unable to manufacture more. While durable, they rarely last more than a decade, so even the best cared for of the old void rifles degraded into uselessness centuries ago. These highly effective weapons are credited with helping the Remnant safeguard their refuges from ground-based threats during their early years."

	description "This weapon was originally developed in an attempt to reverse engineer a long-range energy projectile favored by an alien species that the Remnant encountered nearby. In the process they discovered that by adding more energy to the projectiles they could do a lot more damage in exchange for shorter range, and the Thrasher Cannon was born."
	description "The Ember Waste is the sort of place where only a very foolish captain would travel without some sort of device for replenishing hyperspace fuel. While this risk is non-existent in Remnant ships due to their 'gills' which are effectively built-in ramscoops, some captains prefer to speed up the process by adding additional capacity. For the rare captain braving the area in non-Remnant ships, this ramscoop is not particularly powerful, but it allows a ship to explore without fear of getting stranded."
